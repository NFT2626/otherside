			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Ryder Ripps recent NFT work has been centered around provocations and inquiries regarding the nature of NFT, provenance and digital
				ownership. Provenance has always been the definitive aspect in establishing an artwork’s meaning and value. The
				technology of NFTs is widely misunderstood, but in its greatest form, it enables an immutable trace of origin in time to
				the publisher/creator of a digital work.<br>
				<br>
				Since December of 2021, RR have been investigating the most prominent NFT project, Bored Ape Yacht Club and its creators,
				Yuga Labs. Through months of intensive research, RR and other community members have discovered extensive
				connections between BAYC and subversive internet nazi troll culture. You can read the findings at
				http://GordonGoner.com made by Ryder Ripps, warning this website contains sensitive content not suitable for children.<br>
				<br>
				On Wednesday, May 13th 2022, Ryder Ripps began creating new work in the form of NFTs, based on the BAYC images. Through the
				process of “re-minting”, the original BAYC images are recontextualized – illuminating truths about their origins and
				meanings as well as the nature of Web3 – the power of NFTs to change meaning, establish provenance and evade censorship.<br>
				<br>
				On April 2022, NFT2626 began Minting Otherside NFTS renamed Otherdeed as Contemporary Conceptual Narrative Artwork.
				OtherDeed just like RR/BAYC uses satire and appropriation to protest and educate people regarding Otherdeed for Otherside and the framework
				of NFTs. The work is an extension of and in the spirit of other artists who have worked within the field of
				appropriation art.<br>
